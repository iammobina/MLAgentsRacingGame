"# Reinforcement Learning Flight Racing game with Machine learning agents"

##### (This repository will be updated soon!!!)

 I'm implementing a Flight Racing Game with Machine Learning Agents. This game includes two airplanes, and they start racing from the starting point to the game map's destination. With reinforcement learning and rewards for every step they take, the airplanes learn how to reach the final destination.
